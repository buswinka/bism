BISM Roadmap!

# Strategy:

Every base class will just be semantic / instance. Nothing special, just like generic, input, output shit 
Each dataloader will be for a custom purpose. We will try to avoid as much abstraction as possible. 
I want this to be readable FIRST. Performant SECOND. Abstracted LAST. If someone cant use this as a reference on 
how to implement their own shit, then Ive done something wrong. It should be clear! 

Dataloaders:
    - generic dataload
