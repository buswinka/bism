IDEAS:

	- bism gui: a quick inspector of trained model files. 
		- could load up two models and compare
		- run accuracy stats n stuff
	- bism experiment planner:
		- define a set of config files, run each until convergence over a set of multiple days. Make error tolerant. 
	- bism compare tool:
		- define multiple config files, and one or more reference images, and create a table of accuracy stats.
